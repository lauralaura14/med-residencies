# Med-Residencies

This is a MVC Sinatra application for medical residency applicants to share their residency interview experiences. It uses ActiveRecord associations with Sinatra and contains multiple models to define appropriate relationships. These allow for applicants to create user accounts, permitting them to subsequently log in; they can then create, edit, and delete their own entry submissions. Once logged in, users can also view other applicants' interview experiences.
